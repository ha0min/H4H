## Inspiration

**Hypothesis**
- A Role Playing Game that stimulates the the Trauma stressors, symptoms and coping mechanisms can setup a safe environment for people to explore and learn more about trauma, to get the knowledge to identify and cope with possible trauma symptoms. 
- Family Traumas are more common than people may think. 

**Potential Users**
- People who are aware of their family traumas and are trying to heal from them.
- People who are going through anxieties or depressions which may be caused by previous family traumas that theyâ€™re not aware of.
- people who are interested in mental health and want to learn more about family traumas

## What it does
"Our project is a seed of change; watering it with play grows understanding and recovery." - Just as seeds grow into plants with care, engaging with our game cultivates growth in understanding and recovery from trauma.

## How we built it
* Learned about basic knowledge about family traumas, trauma symptoms, coping mechanisms, then designed narratives and gameplay based on it. 
* Built the game via RPG JS framework.

## Challenges we ran into
* Making a game is time consuming.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a complete RPG experience that explicitly shows the traumatic history, triggered symptoms, coping mechanisms of a typical family trauma. 

## What we have learned
Our mental capacity to deal with stress also dropped after staying too late... 


## What's next? 
Conduct User Survey and Evaluation the Effects:
- Is it really safe?
    - Does the game trigger any emotions for people with similar family traumas?
    - Does pixel game provide a safe enough environment for psychological trauma survivor?
- Is it really helpful?
    - does the users learn something useful or knowledge about trauma?

Update the design based on the User Survey.
